# Section 3: Setting Up Your Development Environment

## Objectives

Once your device has been set-up, you will now need to prepare your development environment. This will allow you to create your Android Project and connect your device to your Reliant Application that will be used in later sections.

At the end of this section you will have done the following:

- Configure Android Studio
- Create a new project OR configure an existing project for Community Pass integration
- Connect Android Studio to your device
- Run a simple “Hello world” application to test your setup
